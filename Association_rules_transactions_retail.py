Problem Statement: - 
A retail store in India, has its transaction data, and it would like to 
know the buying pattern of the consumers in its locality, you have been
assigned this task to provide the manager with rules 
on how the placement of products needs to be there in shelves so that 
it can improve the buyingpatterns of consumes and increase customer 
footfall.

# Association Rule

# Here we are going to use transactional data where in the size of each row is not consistent
# We can not use pandas to load this unstructured data

# Create an empty list

# Splitting the data into seperate transactions using seperator, it is comma seperated
# we can use new line charecter "\n"

# Earlier transaction_retail data strucure was in string format now it will change into 
# 557040 , each item is commma seperated 
# our main aim is to calculate #A, #C, 
# we will have to seperate out each item form each transaction 
transaction_retail_list = []
for i in transaction_retail:
    transaction_retail_list.append(i.split(","))
#split functionn will seperate each item from each list, whenever it will find 
#in order to generate association rules, you can directly use transaction_retail_list 
#Now let us seperate out each item from the transaction_retail_list 
all_transaction_retail_list=[i for item in transaction_retail_list for i in item]
#You will get all the items occured in all transactions 
#we will get 3348059 items in various transactions

#Now lwt us count the frequency of each item
#we will import collections package which has Counter frunction which will 
from collections import Counter 
item_frequencies = Counter (all_transaction_retail_list)
#item_frequencies is basically dictionary having x[0] as key and x[1] = values 
#we want to access values and sort baseed on the count theat occured in it. 
#it will show the counmt of each item purchased in every transactinon 
#Now let us sort these frequencies in ascending order 
item_frequencies=sorted(item_frequencies.items(),key=lambda x:x[1])
#When we execute this, item frequencies will be in sorted form , in the form of item name with count 
#Let us seperate out items and their count

#This is list comprehension forn each item in item frequencies access the key 
#here you will het items list 
frequencies = list(reversed([i[1] for i in item_frequencies]))
#here you will get count of purchase of each item 

#Now let us plot bar graph of item frequencies 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
#here we are taking frequencies from zero to 11, you can try 0-15 or any other

#labels in degrees or with keywords

import pandas as pd
#now let us try to establish association rule mining 
#we have transaction_retail list in the list format, we need to convert it in dataframe 
transaction_retail_series = pd.DataFrame(pd.Series(transaction_retail_list))
#Now we will get dataframe of size 9836x1 size, columns comprises of multiple items 
#we had extra row created , check the groceeries_series, last_row is empty, let us first delete it  
transaction_retail_series = transaction_retail_series.iloc[:9835,:] 
#we have taken rows from 0 to 9834  and columns 0 to all 
#transaction_retail series has column having name 0, let us rename as transactions
transaction_retail_series.columns=["Transactions"]
#Now we will have to apply 1-hot encoding, before that in one column there are various items seperated by ','
#let us seperate it with '*'

#check the x in variable explorer which has * seperator rather that ','
x=x.str.get_dummies(sep='*')
#you will get one hot encoded data frame of size 9835x169
#This is our input data to applyy to apriori algorithm, it will generate !169 rules, min support values 
#is 0.0075 (it must be between 0 to 1),
#you can give any number but must be between 0 to 1 
frequent_itemsets = apriori(x,min_support=0.0075,max_len=4,use_colnames=True)

#Support values will be sorted in descending order 
#Even EDA was also have the same trend, in EDA there was count

#we will generate  association rules, This association rule will calculate all the matrix of each and every combination
