Problem Statement: - 
A Mobile Phone manufacturing company wants to launch its three 
brand new phone into the market, but before going with its traditional 
marketing approach this time it want to analyze the data of its
previous model sales in different regions and you have been hired 
as an Data Scientist to help them out, use the Association rules 
concept and provide your insights to the companyâ€™s marketing team to 
improve its sales.
